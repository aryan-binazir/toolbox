# toolbox

Personal collection of scripts and utilities. Various languages, zero polish, works-for-me quality.

## media-scripts

Python scripts for file/directory management (run with `uv run`):

- `consolidate_files` – flatten nested files into one directory
- `delete_empty_dirs` – remove empty directories
- `delete_moved_files` – delete files from source that already exist in destination (by hash comparison)
- `split_dir` – split large directories into smaller chunks
